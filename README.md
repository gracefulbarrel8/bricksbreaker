Python Brick Breaker Game
Hi! I'm a Grade 11 student and this is my version of the classic Brick Breaker game. I built this using Python and the Turtle library for my computer science project.

About the Project
In this game, you control a paddle at the bottom of the screen to bounce a ball and break all the blocks. If the ball falls past your paddle, you lose a life!

Features
Smooth Controls: I fixed the movement so you can hold down the arrow keys to move the paddle smoothly instead of tapping them.

Scoreboard: Keeps track of how many blocks you've broken.

Lives System: You start with a set amount of lives, making the game more challenging.

Class Organization: I split the code into different files (like ball.py, paddle.py, and block.py) to make it easier to read and fix.

How to Run It
Make sure you have Python installed on your computer.

Download all the .py files into one folder.

Run main.py.

Use the Left and Right arrow keys to move the paddle.

Challenges I Solved
The hardest part was getting the paddle to move smoothly. At first, it would only move one step every time I clicked. I learned how to use a "keys_pressed" list to check if a button is being held down, which made the gameplay feel much better.
